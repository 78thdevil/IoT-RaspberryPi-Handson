## MPU-6050

Motion Interface is becoming a “must-have” function being adopted by smartphone and tablet manufacturers due to the enormous value it adds to the end user experience. In smartphones, it finds use in applications such as gesture commands for applications and phone control, enhanced gaming, augmented reality, panoramic photo capture and viewing, and pedestrian and vehicle navigation. With its ability to precisely and accurately track user motions, Motion Tracking technology can convert handsets and tablets into powerful 3D intelligent devices that can be used in applications ranging from health and fitness monitoring to location-based services. Key requirements for Motion Interface enabled devices are small package size, low power consumption, high accuracy and repeatability, high shock tolerance, and application specific performance programmability – all at a low consumer price point.

The MPU-60X0 is the world’s first integrated 6-axis Motion Tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor (DMP) all in a small 4x4x0.9mm package. With its dedicated I2C sensor bus, it directly accepts inputs from an external 3-axis compass to provide a complete 9-axis Motion Fusion output. The MPU-60X0 Motion Tracking device, with its 6-axis integration, on-board Motion Fusion, and run-time calibration firmware, enables manufacturers to eliminate the costly and complex selection, qualification, and system level integration of discrete devices, guaranteeing optimal motion performance for consumers. The MPU-60X0 is also designed to interface with multiple non inertial digital sensors, such as pressure sensors, on its auxiliary I2C port. The MPU-60X0 is footprint compatible with the MPU-30X0 family.

### STORY
In this project we will be using the world’s first and only 6-axis motion tracking device MPU6050 which combines the 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer. Both the gyroscope and the accelerometer are embedded on a small chip.

#### 3-Axis Gyroscope
The MPU6050 consist of 3-axis Gyroscope with Micro Electro Mechanical System(MEMS) technology. It is used to detect rotational velocity along the X, Y, Z axes as shown in below figure.

-  When the gyros are rotated about any of the sense axes, the Coriolis Effect causes a vibration that is detected by a MEM inside MPU6050.
- The resulting signal is amplified, demodulated, and filtered to produce a voltage that is proportional to the angular rate.
-  This voltage is digitized using 16-bit ADC to sample each axis.
-  The full-scale range of output are +/- 250, +/- 500, +/- 1000, +/- 2000.
-  It measures the angular velocity along each axis in degree per second unit.

#### 3-Axis Accelerometer
The MPU6050 consist 3-axis Accelerometer with Micro Electro Mechanical (MEMs) technology. It used to detect angle of tilt or inclination along the X, Y and Z axes as shown in below figure.

-  Acceleration along the axes deflects the movable mass.
-  This displacement of moving plate (mass) unbalances the differential capacitor which results in sensor output. Output amplitude is proportional to acceleration.
-  16-bit ADC is used to get digitized output.
-  The full-scale range of acceleration are +/- 2g, +/- 4g, +/- 8g, +/- 16g.
-  It measured in g (gravity force) unit.
-  When device placed on flat surface it will measure 0g on X and Y axis and +1g on Z axis.

The MPU6050 uses I2C interface to communicate with the Pi. It uses only 4 pins out of the given 8 pins for the I2C communication. Various parameters can be found by reading values from addresses of certain registers using I2C communication. Gyroscope and the accelerometer reading along the X, Y and Z axes are available in 2’s compliment. The readings from the gyro are in **degrees per second (dps) unit** and the accelerometer readings are in **g (gravity force) unit**. The connections are quite simple and can be made easily.

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Setting up the Hardware Part
1.	Insert the Micro SD card containing the Raspbian OS into the Raspberry Pi 3. (The slot for the Micro SD is at the bottom of the Pi.)
1.	Connect the Raspberry Pi 3 to a monitor (output device) with the help of a HDMI cable. (If your monitor is VGA type then you should have a HDMI to VGA converter.) 
2.	Connect the mouse and keyboard (input devices) in the USB slots provided (4 slots)
3.	Power up the Pi by connecting it to a power supply and wait for the Raspbian OS to load (This may take some time)
4.	Make the connections as per the circuit diagrams. (You can make the connections before connecting the input and output devices as well)

#### Running the program
1.	Copy the code from the GitHub repository and paste it in **python3.5 (IDLE)**
2.	Save the code by giving it any name. 
3.	Run the program by pressing **F5** or clicking run from the main menu.
4.	Once the output is seen hold the MPU6050 module horizontally, vertically and diagonally and observe the output change to 1 for that respective axis i.e. X, Y and Z axes.
