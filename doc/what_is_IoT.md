# Era of Internet of Things(IoT)
## What is Internet of Things(IoT)
IoT refers for Internet Of Things(IoT).Basically it is the **connecting any device**(including everything from cellphones,vehicles,home appliances and other wearable embedded with sensors and actuators) **with Internet** so that these objects can exchange data with each other on a network.  
It is interesting to note that there is a **difference between IoT and the Internet ,it is the absence of Human role. The IoT devices can create information about individual’s behaviors, analyze it, and take action(IoT is smarter than Internet :D)**

## Life is easier with IoT
A question would arise in your mind that why we are concerned about IoT? Here is the answer that why you should be concerned about IoT    
Say for example you are on your way to a meeting, your car could have access to your calendar and already know the best route to take.If the traffic is heavy your car might send a text to the other party notifying them that you will be late.  

What if your alarm clock wakes up you at 6 a.m. and then notifies your coffee maker to start making coffee for you?  

Being able to turn the lights on in your house or heating before coming home using your smartphone?  

Yes, all these things are possible because of IoT.



## Forecast of Gartner
Technology consulting firm Gartner projects that 6.4 billion connected things will be in use worldwide this year, up 30 percent from last year. And Gartner forecasts that number will grow by more than three times, to nearly **21 billion by the year 2020**.

## Application areas for the Internet of Things
### 1.) Smart Home  

The concept of Smart Home is brought up to save time, energy and money.  

With the introduction of Smart Homes,it would be able to switch on air conditioning before reaching home or switch off lights even after leaving home or unlock the doors to friends for temporary access even when you are not at home.

### 2.) Smart cities  

Smart surveillance, automated transportation, smarter energy management systems, water distribution, urban security and environmental monitoring all are examples of internet of things applications for smart cities.  

IoT will solve major problems faced by the people living in cities like pollution, traffic congestion and shortage of energy supplies etc.  

By installing sensors and using web applications, citizens can find free available parking slots across the city. Also, the sensors can detect meter tampering issues, general malfunctions and any installation issues in the electricity system.

### 3.) Wearables  
Wearable devices are installed with sensors and softwares which collect data and information about the users. This data is later pre-processed to extract essential insights about user.  

These devices broadly cover fitness, health and entertainment requirements. The pre-requisite from internet of things technology for wearable applications is to be highly energy efficient or ultra-low power and small sized.

### 4.) Healthcare
IoT in healthcare is aimed at empowering people to live healthier life and regular checkup by wearing connected devices.
The collected data will help in personalized analysis of an individual’s health and provide tailor made strategies to combat illness

## Challangs to IoT 
In the era of IoT, everything is connected, linked up — much more than we see in and around us.IoT is certainly opening door to a lot of opportunities but also to many challenges.

### 1.) Security Challenges--IoT can be _hacked_
Security is a big issue with IoT devices. With billions of devices being connected together over Internet, how can people be sure that their information is secure?These security issues can be of the following kinds  

#### Data Encryption  
IoT applications collect tons of data. Data retrieval and processing is integral part of the whole IoT environment. Most of this data is personal and needs to be protected through encryption.  

Encryption is widely used on the internet to protect user information being sent between a browser and a server, including passwords, payment information and other personal information that should be considered private. Organizations and individuals use encryption to protect sensitive data stored on computers, servers and mobile devices like phones or tablets.      
#### Data Authentication  
After successful encryption of data chances of device itself being hacked still exist. If there is no way to establish the authenticity of the data being communicated to and from an IoT device, security is compromised.  

For instance, say you built a temperature sensor for smart homes. Even though you encrypt the data it transfers is there is no way to authenticate the source of data then anyone can make up fake data and send it to your sensor instructing it to cool the room even when its freezing or vice versa.
#### Side-channel Attacks
Encryption and authentication both in place still leave scope for side channel attacks. Such attacks focus less on the information and more on how that information is being presented.  

For instance if someone can access data like timing information, power consumption or electromagnetic leak, all of this information can be used for side channel attacks.  
### 2.) Privacy Challenges- Private information can be stolen
Then we have the issue of privacy and data sharing. That is because these devices not only collect personal information like users’ names and telephone numbers, but can also monitor user activities (e.g., when users are in their houses and what they had for lunch).
### 3.) Connectivity Challenges--Billions of devices on a centralized server 
One of the biggest challenges for IoT in the future is to connect large number of devices and massive amounts of data that all of these devices are going to produce.There will be need to find out a way to store, track, analyze and make sense of the vast amounts of data that will be generated.  

Presently, we rely upon centralized, server/client model to authorize, authenticate, and connect several nodes present on the network. This model is sufficient for the number of IoT devices that are currently a part of the ecosystem. However, in the future, when hundreds of billions of devices will join the network, it will be diffiult to manage all the data.Moreover, the capability of current cloud servers is so less that it can breakdown if it has to handle large amounts of information.
### 4.) Compatibility and Longevity Challenges-Extra hardware and software
Different technologies like ZigBee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and, Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) are all battling to become the dominant transport mechanism between devices and hubs. This becomes a major source of problems when a lot of devices have to be connected, such dense connectivity requires the deployment of extra hardware and software.  

Conversations about the IoT are taking place all over the world as we are trying to understand how this will impact our lives. We are also trying to understand what the many opportunities and challenges are going to be as more and more devices start to join the IoT.So, all that we can do is educate ourselves about what the IoT is and how it will be after some years....
