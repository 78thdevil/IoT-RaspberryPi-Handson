# RASPBIAN INSTALLATION

Raspbian is the Foundationâ€™s official supported operating system for all models of the Raspberry Pi. 
Raspbian is based on **Debian**, which is a Linux distribution. 
It's called Raspbian because it's a portmanteau of Raspberry and Debian.It's the best choice for general use. 
Raspbian comes pre-installed with plenty of software for education, programming and general use. It has **Python, Scratch, Sonic Pi, Java, Mathematica** and more.


You can install it with NOOBS, or you can write a Raspbian image directly. 

Use **Etcher** to write the image to your SD card and you will be ready to boot.  



Download it here, or use NOOBS, our easy installer for Raspbian and more.

You can install it with NOOBS or download the image below and follow our installation guide.



The Raspbian with Desktop image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size, which means that these archives use features which 
are not supported by older unzip tools on some platforms.
If you find that the download appears to be corrupt or the file is not unzipping correctly, please try using 7Zip (Windows) or 
The Unarchiver (Macintosh).
Both are free of charge and have been tested to unzip the image correctly.


Download the image


If you're not using Etcher (see below), you'll need to unzip .zip downloads to get the image file (.img) to write to your SD card.

Note: the Raspbian with PIXEL image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size and uses the ZIP64 format. 
To uncompress the archive, a unzip tool that supports ZIP64 is required. The following zip tools support ZIP64:

7-Zip (Windows)
The Unarchiver (Mac)
Unzip (Linux)
Writing an image to the SD card
You will need to use an image writing tool to install the image you have downloaded on your SD card.

Etcher is a graphical SD card writing tool that works on Mac OS, Linux and Windows, and is the easiest option for most users. 
Etcher also supports writing images directly from the zip file, without any unzipping required. 
To write your image with Etcher:

1.) Download Etcher and install it.
2.) Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside.
3.) Open Etcher and select from your hard drive the Raspberry Pi .img or  .zip file you wish to write to the SD card.
4.) Select the SD card you wish to write your image to.
5.) Review your selections and click 'Flash!' to begin writing data to the SD card.
