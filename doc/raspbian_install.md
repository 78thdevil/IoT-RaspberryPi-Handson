# How to Install RASPBIAN for your Raspberry Pi

Raspbian is the Foundationâ€™s official supported operating system for all models of the Raspberry Pi.It's called Raspbian because it's a portmanteau of Raspberry and **Debian**(a Linux distribution).It's the best choice for general use.  

Raspbian comes pre-installed with plenty of software for education, programming and general use. It has **Python, Scratch, Sonic Pi, Java, Mathematica** and more.  

You can install it with **NOOBS**(just installer for Raspbian), or you can write a Raspbian image directly.  

## 1.) Installing from NOOBS

## 2.) Installing Raspbian directly

### Download the image

The Raspbian with PIXEL image contained in the ZIP archive is over 4GB in size and uses the ZIP64 format.  

To uncompress the archive, a unzip tool that supports ZIP64 is required. The following zip tools support ZIP64:  

* 7-Zip (Windows)  
* The Unarchiver (Mac)
