```

print("Hello World!")
```
## Variables and Types

Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their
type. Every variable in Python is an object.  

### NUMBERS

#### 1. INTEGER

``` myint=2```

#### 2. Floating Point Number

``` myfloat=2.0```

### LISTS

Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. 
Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.  

|Function|Description|
|:--------:|-----------|
|**append()**|Add a single element to the end of the list|
|**extend()**|Add all elements of a list to the another list|
|**pop()**|Removes and returns an element at the given index|
|**del()**|We can delete one or more items from a list using the keyword del.  It can even delete the list entirely|
|**remove()**| Removes an item from the list|
|**insert()**| Insert an item at the defined index|
|**reverse()**|Reverse the order of items in the list|
|**sort()**|Sort items in a list in ascending order|
|**len()**|Gives the total number of elements in list|
