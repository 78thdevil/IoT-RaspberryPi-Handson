# What is a Sensor ???

A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.  

It is a device that converts signals from one energy domain to electrical domain.  

## Sensor Charecteristics

Perforamnce of any device/instrument is measured using certain charecteristics, which are given as follows:

### 1. Sensitivity

The sensitivity of the sensor is defined as the slope of the output characteristic curve (**dy/dx**) or, more generally,**the minimum input of physical parameter that will create a detectable output change.**  
In some sensors, the sensitivity is defined as the input parameter change required to produce a standardized output change.

### 2. Range

The range of the sensor is the maximum and minimum values of applied parameter that can be measured.  

### 3. Resolution

It is the minimal change of the input necessary to produce a detectable change at the output.    
Resolution can be expressed either as a proportion of the reading (or the full-scale reading) or in absolute terms.  

### 4. Accuracy

It is the capacity of a measuring instrument to give **RESULTS close to the TRUE VALUE of the measured quantity**.  
* Depends on inherent limitation of the sensor as well as on shortcoming of measurement process.  
* Accuracy is usually expressed as *accurate to within x percent*.  
* Accuracy is specified either of the following forms:  


### 5. Precision

The concept of precision refers to the **degree of reproducibility** of a measurement. In other words, Precision is the capacity of a measuring instrument to give the same reading when repetitively measuring the same quantity under the same prescribed conditions.  
* Precision implies agreement between successive readings, NOT closeness to the true value.  
* Precision is related to the variance of a set of measurements.  
* Precision is a necessary but not sufficient condition for accuracy. Two terms closely related to precision Repeatability and   Reproducibility.

### 6.  Linearity

The closeness of the calibration curve to a specified straight line shows the linearity of a sensor.  
* Its degree of resemblance to a straight line describes how linear a system is.  
* For an accurate measurement the sensor should follow linear relationship.

### 7. Repeatability

When all operating and environmental conditions remain constant, repeatability is the sensing system’s ability to produce the same 
response for successive measurements.Repeatability is closely related to precision. Both long-term and short-term repeatability estimates can be important for a sensing system.  

### 8. Reproducibility

Reproducibility is the sensing system’s ability to produce the same responses after measurement conditions have been altered.  

For example, if a temperature sensing system shows similar responses; over a long time period, or when readings are performed by 
different operators, or at different laboratories, the system is reproducible.  

### 9.Stability

Stability is a sensing system’s ability to produce the same output value when measuring the same measurand over a period of time.

### 10. Calibaration

A procedure that involves a comparison of the particular instrument with either a primary standard or a secondary standard with a higher accuracy than the instrument is to be calibrated.  

From the above definitions, it can be concluded that:  

1.) An instrument’s Accuracy is a measure of its output‘s veracity.  
2.) An instrument’s Resolution is a measure of the smallest increment or decrement in position that it can measure.  
3.) A position measuring instrument’s Precision its degree of reproducibility.  
4.) A position measuring instrument’s Linearity is a measurement of the deviation between a transducer’s output to the actual displacement being measured.
