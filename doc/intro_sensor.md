# What is a Sensor ???

A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.  

It is a device that converts signals from one energy domain to electrical domain.  

## Sensor Charecteristics

Perforamnce of any device/instrument is measured using certain charecteristics, which are given as follows:

### 1. Sensitivity

The sensitivity of the sensor is defined as the slope of the output characteristic curve (dy/dx) or, more generally,**the minimum input 
of physical parameter that will create a detectable output change.**  
In some sensors, the sensitivity is defined as the input parameter change required to produce a standardized output change.  

For example, in an electronic temperature sensing system, if the output voltageincreases by 1 V, when temperature changes by 0.1 C,
then the sensitivity will be 10 V/ C.

### 2. Range

The range of the sensor is the maximum and minimum values of applied parameter that can be measured.  

### 3. Resolution

This specification is the smallest detectable incremental change of input parameter that can be detected in the output signal. 
Resolution can be expressed either as a proportion of the reading (or the full-scale reading) or in absolute terms.  

### 4. Accuracy

The accuracy of the sensor is the maximum difference that will exist between the actual value (which must be measured by a primary or 
good secondary standard) and the indicated value at the output of the sensor. Again, the accuracy can be expressed either as a 
percentage of full scale or in absolute terms.  

### 5. Precision

The concept of precision refers to the **degree of reproducibility** of a measurement. In other words, if exactly the same value were measured 
a number of times, an ideal sensor would output exactly the same value every time. But real sensors output a range of values distributed 
in some manner relative to the actual correct value.

### 6.  Linearity

The linearity of the transducer is an expression of the extent to which the actual measured curve of a sensor departs from the ideal
curve. Figure 3 shows a somewhat exaggerated relationship between the ideal, or least squares fit, line and the actual measured or 
calibration line (Note in most cases, the static curve is used to determine linearity, and this may deviate somewhat from a dynamic 
linearity) Linearity is often specified in terms of percentage of nonlinearity, which is defined as:

ty.  

### 7. Repeatability

When all operating and environmental conditions remain constant, repeatability is the sensing system’s ability to produce the same 
response for successive measurements.Repeatability is closely related to precision. Both long-term and short-term repeatability estimates
can be important for a sensing system.  

For a temperature sensing system, when ambient temperature remains constant at 21.0 C, if the system shows 21.0, 21.1, and 21.0 C in 
1 min intervals, and shows 22.0, 22.1, and 22.2 C after 1 h, in similar 1 min intervals, the system has a good short-term and poor 
long-term repeatability.  

### 8. Reproducibility

Reproducibility is the sensing system’s ability to produce the same responses after measurement conditions have been altered.  

For example, if a temperature sensing system shows similar responses; over a long time period, or when readings are performed by 
different operators, or at different laboratories, the system is reproducible.  

### 9.Stability

Stability is a sensing system’s ability to produce the same output value when measuring the same measurand over a period of time.

### 10. Calibaration

An instrument’s Accuracy is a measure of its output‘s veracity
An instrument’s Resolution is a measure of the smallest increment or decrement in position that it can measure
A position measuring instrument’s Precision its degree of reproducibility.
A position measuring instrument’s Linearity is a measurement of the deviation between a transducer’s output to the actual displacement being measured
