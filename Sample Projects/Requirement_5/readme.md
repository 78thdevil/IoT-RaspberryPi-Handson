## PARKING BARRICADE
Barricade, from the French barrique (barrel), is any object or structure that creates a barrier or obstacle to control, block passage or force the flow of traffic in the desired direction. Adopted as a military term, a barricade denotes any improvised field fortification, such as on city streets during urban warfare.

Barricades also include temporary traffic barricades designed with the goal of dissuading passage into a protected or hazardous area or large slabs of cement whose goal is to prevent forcible passage by a vehicle. Stripes on barricades and panel devices slope downward in the direction traffic must travel.

### STORY
In this project we had to implement Parking Barricades using an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor. Barricades are used to stop the path of a vehicle. This is just a miniature project so that you can understand the concept of automatic parking barricades. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure how close the approaching vehicle has reached to the barricade. The barricade is mounted on top of the gears of the servo motor. Once the distance of the vehicle is very close the servo motor will move in such a way that it opens a pathway for the car to cross the barricade. 
The connections are made as per the circuit diagram. The program code is written in python 3.5 (IDLE). The Pi controls the ultrasonic sensor and the servo motor. The motor can sometimes move even when a command is not given. This happens because of the incomplete or half pulses generated by the Pi which are passed on to the motor. Usually a servo can rotate from (0-180) degrees, but in this project we will only be using 0 degree and 90 degree rotation to close and open the barricade. The ultrasonic sensor calculates the distance of the approaching vehicle and returns the value. This value is converted into centimetres using the program. When the vehicle reaches near the barricade i.e. the distance between the car and the barricade is less than 5cms then the servo motor rotates 90 degrees and the barricade opens. It remains open for a short duration (2secs) for the vehicle to pass. When the vehicle passes, the barricade closes by itself and repeats the same operation for the other vehicles.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1.	Setup the Pi and make sure everything is running without any problems
2.	Make the connections as per the circuit diagram. Make sure that the servo is firm and does not fall off when it rotates.
3.	Open the IDLE window. Copy and paste the program that is present in the GitHub repository.
4.	Run the code by pressing f5 on the keyboard or run it from the run menu. The servo motor will set itself to 0 degree rotation.
5.	Take a moveable object and place it in front of the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor measures the distance between the sensor and the object and the distance gets displayed as the output of the program.
6.	Consider the object to be a car and move it closer to the sensor. As the car (moveable object) approaches the ultrasonic sensor the distance reduces and as soon as the distance becomes less than 5cms the servo motor rotates to 90 degrees i.e. the gates open.

### NOTE
1.	The program code for this project is available in the **Requirement_5** folder under **sample projects**
2.	The direction of rotation of the servo can change depending on how you have placed the servo after connecting. If so change the degree of rotation in the program code according to your need and it will work just fine
